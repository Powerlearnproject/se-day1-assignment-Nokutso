#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

**Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining computer programs that solve real world problems in a structered way. Software Engineering plays a crucial role in the tech space, which gives it multiple reasons of its importance in the industry. Those being Reliability & Efficiency, Scalability, Security and Innovation. It offers reliabilty in a sense that it ensures dependability and efficiency in a sense that productivity is confirmed for the user that will be using it. Scalability ensures that software engineering will allow their systems to grow and adapt. Security is one of the things that is incorporated in secure coding practices and regular testing within Software Engineering. This safeguards sensitive data and protects against cyber threats. Lastly, Software engineering provides a systematice framework for experimenting with new ideas and technologies, driving innovation and pushing technological boundaries.**


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**1968-Emergence of Software Engineering: The term "software engineering" was popularized during 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, highlighting the need for disciplined approaches to software development. 
1980-Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP paradigms, such as those implemented in languages like C++ and Smalltalk, became prominent, promoting modularity and reusability in software design.
1990-The rise of Software Development Methodologies: Software Engineers began to develop formal methodologies for software development. This included the Waterfall model which outlined a linear approach to software development, and the Agile methodology, which emphasized collaboration and flexibility.**

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Idea Genereation(Planning): This is the first step where the team decides what the software should do, how big the project will be, and how much time and money it will take.
Requirement Analysis: Developers talk to the people who will use the software (clients and users) to understand what they need and how the software should work.
Product Design: The team plans how the software will look and function, including the layout, buttons, and how data will be stored. They also choose the tools they will use.
Product Development (Implementation (coding)): This is where developers write the actual code to build the software, following the design plan.
Integration & Testing: The team checks the software for mistakes (bugs) and makes sure everything works properly before releasing it.
Deployement: The finished software is made available for people to use. It may be tested by a small group first (beta version) before being fully launched.
Maintenance: Even after the software is released, developers fix problems, improve performance, and add new features based on user feedback.**


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**1. Waterfall Methodology
   • It follows a step-by-step approach: Planning → Design → Coding → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
   • Everything is planned in advance, and changes are difficult to make once development starts.
   • Best for: Large projects with clear requirements, like government or banking systems.**
   
**2. Agile Methodology
   • Instead of one big plan, work is done in small cycles (called sprints), with regular feedback.
   • Changes are easy to make, and improvements happen along the way.
   • Best for: Fast-changing projects like mobile apps or websites, where user feedback is important.**


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software Developer
• Role: Writes the code to build the software.
• Responsibilities: Creates the program, fixes bugs, and makes sure it works well.**

**Quality Assurance Engineer
• Role: Makes sure the software is working correctly and is free of bugs.
• Responsibilities: Tests the software, finds problems, and ensures it meets the required standards.**

**Project Manager
• Role: Organizes and manages the project to make sure it's completed on time and within budget.
• Responsibilities: Plans the project, sets deadlines, and coordinates the team to ensure everything runs smoothly.**


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a tool that helps developers write and manage code more efficiently. It combines everything a developer needs into one place, like code editors, debuggers, and compilers e.g. Visual Studio Code. It's importance is to improve coding efficiency by offering tools like code suggestions, debugging, and error checking in one place. Version Control Systems (VCS) helps developers track and manage changes to code over time, especially when multiple people are working on the same project e.g. Git. It's importance is to help developers manage code changes, collaborate with others, and keep track of the project’s history.**
 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
